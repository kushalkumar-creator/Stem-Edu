# Tasks.md: Phase 2 (Intelligence, Immersion and Reach), Supabase edition

**Project:** STEM learning platform for **CBSE Class 10 and Class 12** (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
**Backend stack change:** MongoDB Atlas and the custom JWT login are replaced by **Supabase** (Postgres database, Supabase Auth and `pgvector` for vector search). Setup details, SQL and code are in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`.
**Starts when:** Phase 1 (Tasks 0 to 11) is finished, deployed and working
**Ends when:** every feature in the final feature list below works inside the same website, plus the offline mode

## 0. How to use this file (rules for the user and for any tool or agent)

1. Every task and every subtask has its own checkbox: `- [ ]` means not done, `- [x]` means done.
2. A tool or agent marks a checkbox `- [x]` only when that exact item is finished and verified. It never marks items it did not do.
3. A parent task is marked `- [x]` only after ALL its subtasks are `- [x]`.
4. Task IDs look like `P2-3.4` (Phase 2, section 3, task 4). Do not renumber them; other tasks refer to them.
5. Keep each task to **one sitting** (about 1 to 3 hours). If a task feels bigger, split it into new subtasks instead of skipping it.
6. Order matters inside a section. Sections can overlap only where "Depends on" allows it.
7. Secrets: the agent reads keys only from `process.env` (backend) or `import.meta.env` (frontend). It never prints or hardcodes key values. The variable names live in `backend/.env.example`.
8. Database rule: every table that holds personal data has a `user_id` column and **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled. The backend uses the Supabase service role key, which bypasses RLS, so every backend query on personal data must also filter by the verified user id.

### Legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✍️ | **Hand-write.** The user writes this core logic personally. The agent only guides, explains and reviews. |
| 🆕 | **New technology** for the user. The agent must say it is new, then teach it step by step before implementing. |
| 🔗 | **Depends on** another task. Do not start before that task is `[x]`. |
| ⚠️ | Risk or thing to double check (limits, licences, performance). |

### Naming decision

The AI character (earlier called "Chotu") is renamed **Saarthi** (Sanskrit for "guide / charioteer"). Saarthi is **one character** that works as both the **AI mentor** and the **24/7 doubt solver**. Wherever this file says Saarthi, it means that single character. The name can be changed in task P2-0.2 without affecting anything else.

### Naming rules for the database

- Tables and columns use `snake_case` (for example `chat_sessions`, `class_level`, `preferred_language`).
- `class` is written `class_level` in the database to avoid keyword problems.
- What this file used to call a "model" is now a "table". SQL files live in `backend/sql/` and are numbered (`001_init.sql`, `002_content.sql`, ...).

## P2-1. Multi-board and multi-language support (foundation, do this first)

Reason it comes first: board and language change how content is stored, so every later feature depends on it.
🔗 Depends on P2-0.6.

- [ ] **P2-1.1 Content table upgrade** ✍️
  - [ ] Add columns `board` (CBSE now; ICSE, State boards later), `class_level` (10, 12), `subject`, `language` to the `chapters`, `lessons`, `mcqs`, `videos` and `chunks` tables
  - [ ] Write a SQL migration file (`backend/sql/00x_multiboard.sql`) that tags all Phase 1 seed data as `board = 'CBSE'`, `language = 'en'`
  - [ ] Add composite Postgres indexes on `(board, class_level, subject, language)`
  - [ ] Update admin forms so every content item must choose board, class, subject, language
- [ ] **P2-1.2 Add Class 12 and complete Class 10 content skeleton**
  - [ ] Create chapter lists for Class 10 and Class 12 for all four subjects (titles and order only)
  - [ ] Mark which chapters will get full content, MCQs, video and virtual learning topics first
  - [ ] Seed at least 3 chapters per subject per class with lesson text (more can be added later)
- [ ] **P2-1.3 User preferences** ✍️
  - [ ] The `profiles` table stores `board`, `class_level`, `preferred_language`
  - [ ] Every content API filters by the user's profile unless overridden
  - [ ] "Change board / class / language" screen in settings (updates the user's own `profiles` row)
- [ ] **P2-1.4 UI translation (i18n)** 🆕
  - [ ] Install `react-i18next` and explain how translation files work
  - [ ] Move all hard-coded UI text into `en.json`
  - [ ] Create `hi.json` and the chosen regional language file
  - [ ] Language switcher in the navbar, choice saved in `profiles.preferred_language` and localStorage
  - [ ] Check long words and non-Latin fonts do not break layouts (add Noto Sans fonts)
- [ ] **P2-1.5 Content translation**
  - [ ] Decide approach: admin-entered translations first, Gemini-assisted draft translation second
  - [ ] Add a "Translate this lesson" admin button that asks Gemini for a draft, saved with `status = 'draft'`
  - [ ] Human review screen: admin approves or edits before a translated lesson goes live
  - [ ] Fallback rule: if a translation is missing, show English with a small "not available in your language" note
  - [ ] Translate at least 2 chapters per subject into Hindi and the regional language
- [ ] **P2-1.6 Multi-board readiness check**
  - [ ] Add one small non-CBSE sample chapter to prove the tables work (can be removed later)
  - [ ] Confirm RAG and Saarthi filter by board (verified again in P2-2.8)

---

## P2-2. CBSE-based RAG pipeline 🆕

Goal: Saarthi and the summary tool answer from CBSE material and from the student's own notes, and show where the answer came from.
🔗 Depends on P2-1.1.

- [ ] **P2-2.1 Learn and write down the RAG idea (for viva)**
  - [ ] Write a one-page explanation in `docs/rag.md`: what RAG is, why not just prompt the LLM, what chunks, embeddings and vector search are
  - [ ] Draw the pipeline diagram (ingest, chunk, embed, store, retrieve, prompt, answer, cite)
  - [ ] Write 5 viva questions and answers about RAG
- [ ] **P2-2.2 Source documents** ⚠️
  - [ ] Collect CBSE source material for Class 10 and 12 (NCERT textbooks, CBSE syllabus, sample papers)
  - [ ] Check usage terms of each source. Keep only what is allowed for educational use and note the source on every chunk
  - [ ] Store PDFs in `content/` and list them in a `sources.md` table (title, class, subject, source, licence note)
- [ ] **P2-2.3 Ingestion script** ✍️
  - [ ] Extract text from PDFs (try `pdf-parse` or `pdfjs-dist`; use OCR in P2-6.6 for scanned pages)
  - [ ] Clean text: remove headers, footers, page numbers, broken hyphenation
  - [ ] Chunk by headings first, then by size (start with about 500 tokens and 50 token overlap)
  - [ ] Attach metadata to every chunk: `board, class_level, subject, chapter, page, language, source, type` (`textbook | notes | question | video`)
  - [ ] Save chunks in the `chunks` table (through the service role client)
  - [ ] Make the script re-runnable without duplicating chunks (the `content_hash` column is `unique`; use upsert on it)
- [ ] **P2-2.4 Embeddings and vector store** 🆕
  - [ ] Choose the embedding model (Gemini embedding model, check current name in docs), set its output size to match the `vector(768)` column (or change the column size in SQL if you choose another size), and note it in `Design.md`
  - [ ] Vector store: **Supabase Postgres with `pgvector`** (same database as the rest of the app). Write 3 reasons and one alternative (Chroma, Qdrant) in `Design.md`
  - [ ] Confirm the HNSW index (`vector_cosine_ops`) and the metadata filter columns (`board, class_level, subject, language, user_id`) exist (created in `001_init.sql`); check the Supabase docs for current vector size and index limits
  - [ ] Embed all chunks in batches, respecting rate limits, with retry and progress log
  - [ ] Store the `embedding_model` column so chunks can be re-embedded later if the model changes
- [ ] **P2-2.5 Retrieval service** ✍️
  - [ ] Function `retrieve(query, filters, k)` that embeds the query and calls the `match_chunks` SQL function with `supabaseAdmin.rpc('match_chunks', {...})`
  - [ ] Always filter by board and class; filter by subject when known
  - [ ] Add a minimum similarity score (`min_similarity` argument); return "nothing relevant found" below it
  - [ ] Optional improvement: hybrid search (Postgres full-text search + vector) and re-ranking
  - [ ] Unit tests with 10 known questions and the chunk each should return
- [ ] **P2-2.6 Answer generation with citations** ✍️
  - [ ] Write the prompt template: role, rules, retrieved context, question, answer format
  - [ ] Rule in prompt: answer only from the context; if not found, say so and offer a general answer clearly labelled as such
  - [ ] Return answer plus sources (chapter, page) and show them in the UI
  - [ ] Keep answers at CBSE level for the student's class (simple language)
  - [ ] Reply in the student's preferred language (🔗 P2-1.3)
- [ ] **P2-2.7 User-based RAG (student's own notes)** 🆕
  - [ ] Students can upload text, PDF, or photo notes (photos handled in P2-6.6); original files may be kept in a private Supabase Storage bucket
  - [ ] Each upload is chunked and embedded with `user_id` set on every chunk
  - [ ] Retrieval merges two pools: CBSE chunks (shared, `user_id` is null) and the student's own chunks (private, `user_id` = the verified user), already handled by `match_chunks` through `p_user_id`
  - [ ] Privacy check: one user can never retrieve another user's chunks. Write tests for both layers: the API (user A calls retrieve, gets none of user B's chunks) and RLS (a client signed in as user A with the anon key cannot select user B's rows)
  - [ ] "My knowledge base" page: list, preview and delete uploaded notes (deleting also removes its chunks and vectors, and the stored file)
- [ ] **P2-2.8 Evaluate and tune**
  - [ ] Build a test set of 30 questions (about 8 per subject) with expected chapter
  - [ ] Measure: did the right chunk appear in the top 3 or top 5?
  - [ ] Try 2 chunk sizes and 2 values of `k`; record results in `docs/rag-eval.md`
  - [ ] Confirm board and class filtering works (a Class 10 question must not return Class 12 chunks)
- [ ] **P2-2.9 Admin RAG tools**
  - [ ] Admin page to upload a source PDF, pick metadata, and start ingestion (admin routes use `requireAdmin`)
  - [ ] Show ingestion status and chunk count per document (from the `documents` table)
  - [ ] Re-index and delete document buttons

- [ ] **P2-3.10 24/7 reliability** ⚠️
  - [ ] Handle Gemini errors, quota exhaustion and timeouts with friendly messages
  - [ ] Handle Supabase errors and a paused or unreachable free-tier project with a friendly message
  - [ ] Fallback: if the LLM fails, show the best matching chunks as a plain "From your textbook" answer
  - [ ] Uptime check and error logging (free tier tools such as UptimeRobot and basic logs); the uptime ping also keeps a free Supabase project active
  - [ ] Cache repeated identical questions for a short time to save quota

A new top-level section of the website: **Virtual Learning**. It holds interactive, explorable 3D / simulation topics for all four subjects. Each topic is a page where the student can rotate, play, change values and see what happens.

**Reference (for ideas only):** the demo style of `https://iamtechartist.com/demos/` and the topic pages listed below.
⚠️ Rule: study the references to understand the experience (layout, controls, learning flow), then **build our own versions**. Do not copy their code, models, text, images or assets. If any outside 3D model is used, check its licence and list it in `content/credits.md`.

## P2-12. Offline mode (questions, lectures, notes) 🆕

🔗 Depends on P2-5, P2-6, P2-7, P2-8, P2-9 and P2-10 (to know what to store).
Approach: turn the website into a **PWA** (Progressive Web App) with a service worker and IndexedDB. This also makes the website installable on phones, so no separate mobile app is needed.

- [ ] **P2-12.1 Learn PWA basics (for viva)**
  - [ ] Write `docs/pwa.md`: manifest, service worker, cache vs IndexedDB, online/offline events, background sync
  - [ ] Decide the tool: `vite-plugin-pwa` (Workbox), and write why
- [ ] **P2-12.2 PWA setup**
  - [ ] Web app manifest: name, icons (192, 512, maskable), theme colour, `display: standalone`
  - [ ] Register the service worker; app is installable on Android and desktop
  - [ ] Offline fallback page
- [ ] **P2-12.3 Caching strategy** ✍️
  - [ ] App shell (HTML, JS, CSS, fonts, icons): precache
  - [ ] API data for lessons, questions, notes: network-first with cache fallback or stale-while-revalidate (choose per route and justify)
  - [ ] Never cache Supabase Auth requests or responses that carry tokens
  - [ ] Images and thumbnails: cache-first with size limits
  - [ ] Cache versioning and cleanup of old caches
- [ ] **P2-12.4 Local database (IndexedDB)** 🆕
  - [ ] Use Dexie.js (or `idb`) and define stores: `lessons`, `questions`, `attempts`, `notes`, `downloads`, `syncQueue`
  - [ ] Wrapper functions for read/write kept in `frontend/src/offline/`
- [ ] **P2-12.5 Offline questions**
  - [ ] "Download for offline" per chapter downloads its MCQs into IndexedDB
  - [ ] Tests run entirely from local data and scoring works offline (the same scoring code as online)
  - [ ] Attempts are stored locally and synced to the Supabase `attempts` table when the network returns
- [ ] **P2-12.6 Offline notes**
  - [ ] Notes can be viewed, created and edited offline
  - [ ] Handwritten-style pages (images) cached
  - [ ] Sync queue with conflict rule (last edit wins using `updated_at`, show a note when a conflict was resolved)
- [ ] **P2-12.7 Offline lessons and light interactive content**

  - [ ] Big 3D models are marked "online only" or downloadable with a size warning
- [ ] **P2-12.8 Offline lectures (videos)** ⚠️
  - [ ] Download choice: 360p video or audio-only plus transcript
  - [ ] Show storage used and a "Remove download" button
  - [ ] Store large media with the Cache Storage API, not localStorage; handle storage quota errors
- [ ] **P2-12.9 Offline UX**
  - [ ] Online/offline indicator and a banner when offline
  - [ ] `/offline` page listing everything downloaded
  - [ ] Disable or label features that need the internet (Saarthi, RAG, translation); show helpful text instead of errors
  - [ ] An already signed-in user can open downloaded content offline (the Supabase session is stored in the browser); when the token has expired, show downloaded content anyway and refresh the session once back online
- [ ] **P2-12.10 Sync** ✍️
  - [ ] Background sync (where supported) or sync on reconnect for attempts and notes
  - [ ] Avoid duplicates using client-generated UUIDs as the primary key (Postgres `uuid` columns), with upsert on insert
- [ ] **P2-12.11 Test offline**
  - [ ] Use browser DevTools offline mode and airplane mode on a real phone
  - [ ] Checklist: open the app, take a test, read a note, open a lesson, play a downloaded lecture, then go online and confirm sync

## P2-13. Mobile app (REMOVED from Phase 2)

Decision: the project stays a **website for now**. There is no Android app, Capacitor project, APK or store release in this phase. The ID P2-13 is kept only so the other section numbers do not change. Nothing here needs to be done.

- Phones are still supported through the browser: pages are mobile first, and the offline mode in P2-12 (PWA) makes the website installable.
- If a native app is wanted later, it becomes a new phase after Phase 2 is finished.

  - [ ] Counts (SQL queries or views): users, Saarthi questions per day, most used topics and labs, most asked subjects
  - [ ] AI usage and quota status panel, plus a Supabase usage note (database size and storage against the free-tier limits)

---

## P2-15. Testing, security, performance and deployment

- [ ] **P2-15.1 Security checks** ⚠️
  - [ ] All AI keys and the Supabase service role key only on the server; check the frontend bundle contains no secrets (search the built files for the key prefix)
  - [ ] RLS is enabled on every table with user data; run a check query listing tables where RLS is off
  - [ ] Validate and size-limit all uploads (type, size) and scan filenames; Supabase Storage buckets for user files are private with per-user folder policies
  - [ ] Protect against prompt injection from uploaded notes (treat retrieved text as data, not instructions) and write a test
  - [ ] User data isolation tests (notes, chats, memories, chunks), through the API and through RLS
  - [ ] CORS, helmet and rate limiting reviewed
  - [ ] Auth settings reviewed: email confirmation turned back on, password rules, redirect URLs limited to your real domains
- [ ] **P2-15.2 Privacy**
  - [ ] Privacy page explaining what Saarthi stores and why
  - [ ] "Delete my data" button removing chats, memories, notes, chunks and vectors (`on delete cascade` from `auth.users`; the backend deletes the account with `supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.deleteUser(id)` and removes the user's Storage files)
  - [ ] Extra care for students under 18 (no unnecessary personal data)
- [ ] **P2-15.3 Automated tests**
  - [ ] Unit tests for scoring, retrieval, ray and physics formulas, trig and conic functions
  - [ ] API tests for the main routes (including 401 without a token and 403 for non-admins)
  - [ ] One end-to-end test of the main flow (login, open lesson, ask Saarthi, take MCQ) with Playwright or Cypress, using a dedicated test user
- [ ] **P2-15.4 Performance**
  - [ ] Lighthouse run on the main pages and fix big issues
  - [ ] Code splitting for Three.js, labs and virtual topics
  - [ ] Compress images, models and videos
  - [ ] Postgres indexes checked for common queries (use `explain analyze` on slow ones)
- [ ] **P2-15.5 Accessibility and usability**
  - [ ] Keyboard navigation, readable contrast, alt text, text-size option
  - [ ] Test with 3 real students (Class 10 or 12) and note feedback
- [ ] **P2-15.6 Deployment**
  - [ ] Update environment variables on the host (Supabase URL, anon key, service role key, Gemini key, others from `.env.example`)
  - [ ] Run all `backend/sql/*.sql` files, in order, on the production Supabase project (or confirm the same project is used) and check the `vector` extension and HNSW index exist
  - [ ] Add the deployed frontend URL to Supabase Authentication → URL Configuration
  - [ ] Deploy backend and frontend
  - [ ] Set up error monitoring and uptime checks
  - [ ] Backup plan for the database (Supabase backups or scheduled `pg_dump`; check what the free tier includes) and `content/`
- [ ] **P2-15.7 Documentation and demo**
  - [ ] Update `README.md` with setup steps (including Supabase setup and SQL files) and screenshots
  - [ ] Architecture diagram covering RAG, Saarthi, Supabase (Auth, Postgres, pgvector), offline sync and the website
  - [ ] Demo script of 5 minutes (Virtual Learning, a lab, Saarthi with citations, offline mode, website on a phone)
  - [ ] Viva sheet: 25 questions and answers covering RAG, embeddings, memory, PWA, Three.js, i18n, Supabase Auth, RLS and security
  - [ ] Tag release `v2.0`

---

## Final acceptance checklist (Phase 2 is done only when all are `[x]`)

- [ ] Login, signup and logout work through Supabase Auth, and the app no longer uses MongoDB or custom JWT code
- [ ] A student can pick **CBSE, Class 10 or 12, and a language**, and all content follows that choice
- [ ] Saarthi answers CBSE doubts at any time, with sources, in the chosen language, and remembers the student across sessions (with the ability to view and delete memory)
- [ ] RAG works with both CBSE content and the student's own notes, and user data stays private (verified by tests on both the API and RLS)
- [ ] Gemini summary has length/style options and works on lessons and notes
- [ ] MCQs include AI-generated, admin-approved questions, timed tests and weak-topic results
- [ ] Typed text can be turned into handwriting-style pages (PNG/PDF), and photographed handwritten notes can be read by OCR
- [ ] Interactive diagrams exist for all four subjects
- [ ] **Virtual Learning** section has all 9 topics published: heart, skeleton and muscles, respiration, light and optics, waves and sound, Newton's laws, molecule viewer with 2 examples, trigonometry, conic sections
- [ ] 3D labs exist for physics, chemistry and biology, with observation tables and lab reports
- [ ] At least one video per subject plays on the site (dummy videos allowed), with subtitles and progress saving
- [ ] The Discord community is set up and linked from the site
- [ ] Questions, lectures and notes work offline and sync when back online
- [ ] Security, privacy, performance and deployment tasks are finished and the demo and viva sheet are ready

## Appendix A. Difficulty guide (hardest first)

1. CBSE RAG pipeline and user-based RAG (new concepts: chunking, embeddings, vector search with pgvector, evaluation)
2. Saarthi memory (context storing) and prompt building
3. Offline mode with sync (service worker, IndexedDB, conflicts, auth sessions)
4. 3D models and animations for the Virtual Learning section (asset creation, performance on phones)
5. 3D labs with step logic
6. Conic cone-slicing and ray-optics simulations (maths and visuals together)
7. Handwriting renderer and OCR
8. Supabase Auth, SQL tables and Row Level Security (new concepts: policies, service role vs anon key)
9. Multi-language content
10. AI video production (tool limits)
11. Discord community (easy, mostly setup)
12. Summary and MCQ upgrades (closest to Phase 1)

## Appendix B. Non-code risks

- **Content volume:** two classes x four subjects is a lot; ship a few good chapters per subject first, then add more
- **3D assets:** good free models are limited; plan time for Blender or searching for properly licensed models
- **Licences:** textbooks, 3D models, fonts and videos each have terms; record them in `content/credits.md`
- **Free-tier limits:** Gemini quota, Supabase (database size including vectors, storage, bandwidth, and pausing of inactive projects), video hosting and bandwidth
- **Key safety:** the Supabase service role key bypasses all RLS; if it ever leaks (for example on GitHub), reset it in the Supabase dashboard immediately
- **Low-end phones:** 3D and video must have low-quality modes
- **Accuracy:** AI answers and AI-generated MCQs must be checked by a human before students rely on them
- **Time:** course sections to finish by 1 January and December exams; start Phase 2 sections only after Phase 1 is deployed on Supabase, and take Sections 1 to 5 first
